Conditions Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model for respiratory conditions, specifically conjunctivities, using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze patient data and environmental factors to predict the likelihood of developing respiratory conjunctivities.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes:

Patient Data: Age, gender, pre-existing conditions, etc.
Environmental Factors: Air quality index (AQI), pollen count, humidity, etc.
Symptoms: Coughing, sneezing, red eyes, etc.
Medical History: Previous respiratory issues, treatments, etc.
Data Sources
Source 1: XYZ Medical Data Repository
Source 2: ABC Environmental Database
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Feature engineering
Normalization/Standardization
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/respiratory-conditions-prediction.git
cd respiratory-conditions-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the data:
Ensure that the dataset is placed in the data/ directory.

Train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Evaluate the model:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py
Make predictions:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input "path_to_input_data"
Example
To run the model on a new dataset:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input "data/new_patient_data.csv"
Modeling Approach
Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression: Initial baseline model
Random Forest: Improved model with better accuracy
